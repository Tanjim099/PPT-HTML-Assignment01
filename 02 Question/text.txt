Semantic tags in HTML are elements that provide meaning and structure to the 
content within a web page. They describe the purpose or role of the content,
rather than just its appearance. Semantic tags help search engines,
assistive technologies, and other tools understand the content better,
which can lead to improved accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO),
and overall user experience.

Here are some common semantic tags in HTML5:

<header>: Represents the introductory content or a group of navigational links at the top of a page.
<nav>: Defines a section containing navigation links.
<main>: Represents the main content of a document or application.
<article>: Represents a self-contained composition within a document, such as a blog post or news article.
<section>: Defines a standalone section of content.
<aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the surrounding content, like sidebars or pull quotes.
<footer>: Represents the footer of a page or a section.
<figure> and <figcaption>: Used together to represent self-contained content, such as images or diagrams, along with a caption.
By using semantic tags appropriately, you provide a clear structure to your HTML document,
making it easier for both humans and machines to understand. Here are a few reasons
why semantic tags are important:
