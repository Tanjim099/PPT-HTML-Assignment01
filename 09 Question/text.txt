In HTML, tags and attributes serve different purposes:

Tags: HTML tags define the structure and content of elements in an HTML document.
They are enclosed within angle brackets (< and >). Tags can be either opening tags
(<tag>) or self-closing tags (<tag />). Examples of HTML tags include <div>, <p>, <img>, <a>, etc.

Attributes: HTML attributes provide additional information or properties to HTML elements.
They are used within the opening tag of an element and provide specific instructions or details about the element.
Attributes consist of a name-value pair separated by an equals sign (=). Examples of HTML attributes include src,
alt, href, class, id, etc.
