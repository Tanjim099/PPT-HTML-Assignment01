The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML document.
It is a self-closing tag and requires the src attribute to specify
the path to the image file. The <img> tag can also include attributes
like alt (alternate text), width, height, etc., to provide additional
information about the image.

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="200" height="150">

On the other hand, the <figure> tag is used to encapsulate media content,
such as images, illustrations, diagrams, videos, etc., along with their
associated captions or descriptions. It is a container element that provides
a semantic structure to group media and its corresponding content.

<figure>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="200" height="150">
    <figcaption>Caption or description of the image</figcaption>
</figure>
